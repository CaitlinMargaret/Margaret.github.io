    <p style="margin-left: 23%; margin-right: 23%; text-align: justify;">When you think about what psychology has to offer about understanding yourself and others, what's the first issue that comes to mind? Do you think that psychology's role is to help identify and treat disorders such as depression, anxiety, or perhaps narcissism? Or perhaps you prefer to view psychology as providing a pathway to mental health by showing how to cultivate your inner strengths and resources. Could psychology, following from this approach, help you achieve greater well-being?</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 26%; margin-right: 26%; text-align: center;">Cultivating Social Intelligence: 3 Ways to Understand Others</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 23%; margin-right: 23%; text-align: justify;">Have you ever noticed how some people can effortlessly talk to anyone they meet, no matter how divergent their backgrounds?
        Or have you seen that one person who always offends someone, no matter the topic of conversation?
        These two scenarios depict how we can differ in our abilities to interact, get along with, and relate to others around us. In the same way that we vary in traditional academic competencies, we can vary in how socially competent we are. After years of academic research and development, this social competency is now commonly referred to as 'social intelligence.''
